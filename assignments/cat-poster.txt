            <h2>Cat poster</h2>

            <p>In this assignemnt, I had to create a poster based on gestalt principles and semiotics</p>
            
            <p>For it, first I was thinking about which principle I was going to choose to utilize. After looking over them, I decided to go with the principle of symmetry</p>
            
            <p>When thinking about symmetrical things, the first thing that came to mind was a cat paw <span class="in-line-image-link" onclick="loadTextImage(this)">[1]</span></p>

            <p>After I got referance pictures for it, I opened up Adobe Illustrator and used the picture to make a vector <span class="in-line-image-link" onclick="loadTextImage(this)">[2]</span></p>

            <p>After I made the vector I thought it was too simple and wanted to do something more. I wanted to use the symbol somewhere else to give something else a different meaning</p>
            
            <p>That's when I thought of the idea for a cat cafe. I could draw a coffee cup with some coffee beans to represent a café and add the cat paw graphic to the cup to represent a "cat" themed café</p>
            
            <p>I took a referance pic for the coffee cup and coffee beans and created another vector image of it <span class="in-line-image-link" onclick="loadTextImage(this)">[3]</span></p>

            <p>After that, all I needed to do was add both images together <span class="in-line-image-link" onclick="loadTextImage(this)">[4]</span></p>

            <p>Overall, I liked the idea of this assignment, but I am not too familiar with adobe illustrator and creating vector art, so it was difficult for me to figure out how to do simmetrical art. Even with the execution not being exactly like I wanted, I enjoyed this challenge and the learning a new program</p>
