        <p>In this assignemnt, I had to make a Customer Journey for a person looking to buy a new phone</p>

        <p>There are various templates online, but the one I chose was from Figma</p>

        <p>I had to think about all the steps the user would take, from coming up with the desire to buy a phone to after the purchase, and assign additional goals, feelings and pain/gain points for each step</p>
